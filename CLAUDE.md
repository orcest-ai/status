## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

_To be determined as the tech stack is chosen. Update this section when dependencies are added._

### Getting Started

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd status
# Install steps TBD
```

## Build & Run

_No build system configured yet. Update this section when a framework/toolchain is selected._

## Testing

_No test framework configured yet. Update this section when tests are added._

## Linting & Formatting

_No linter or formatter configured yet. Update this section when tooling is added._

## Key Conventions

### Git Workflow

- Default branch: `master`
- Use descriptive commit messages that explain the "why" not just the "what"
- Keep commits focused and atomic

### Code Style

_To be established. Update this section as the codebase grows and conventions emerge._

### Architecture Decisions

_Document significant architecture decisions here as they are made._

## AI Assistant Guidelines

When working on this codebase:

1. **Read before writing** — Always read existing files before proposing changes
2. **Keep it simple** — Avoid over-engineering; implement only what is requested
3. **Update this file** — When adding new tooling, frameworks, or conventions, update the relevant sections of this CLAUDE.md
4. **No unnecessary files** — Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones
5. **Security first** — Do not introduce common vulnerabilities (XSS, injection, etc.)
6. **Minimal changes** — Don't refactor or "improve" code beyond the scope of the current task
